# 🧩 Assortment

## 📝 Overview
The Assortment project contains a collection of C++ programs demonstrating fundamental array operations and manipulations. These programs focus on both one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, showcasing different ways to process and analyze array data.

## 📂 Contents

### 1. ➖ Negative Number Finder (`1.cpp`)
A program that identifies and displays negative numbers from a user-input array.
- 📥 Takes user input for array size and elements
- 🔍 Iterates through the array to find negative values
- 📊 Displays all negative numbers found in the array
- 🔄 Demonstrates basic array traversal and conditional checking

### 2. 📈 Maximum Element Finder (`2.cpp`)
A program that finds the largest element in a two-dimensional array.
- 📥 Takes user input for row and column dimensions
- 🔢 Allows user to input elements for the 2D array
- 🔍 Uses nested loops to traverse the matrix
- 🏆 Tracks and identifies the maximum value
- 🧩 Demonstrates 2D array handling and comparison operations

### 3. 🔄 Matrix Transpose (`3.cpp`)
A program that performs a transpose operation on a matrix (2D array).
- 📥 Takes user input for row and column dimensions
- 🔢 Allows user to input elements for the 2D array
- 🔄 Displays the transpose of the matrix (rows become columns)
- 🧩 Demonstrates advanced 2D array manipulation
- 📊 Shows how to change the traversal order for matrix transformation

### 4. ➕ Row and Column Sum Calculator (`4.cpp`)
A program that calculates the sum of elements in a specified row or column of a 2D array.
- 📥 Takes user input for row and column dimensions
- 🔢 Allows user to input elements for the 2D array
- 🔍 Asks user which row and column to analyze
- ➕ Calculates and displays the sum of elements in the specified row and column
- ✅ Includes input validation to prevent out-of-bounds access
- 📊 Demonstrates targeted array traversal and accumulation operations

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run
Each C++ program can be compiled and executed using a C++ compiler such as g++:

```bash
# To compile
g++ -o program1 1.cpp
g++ -o program2 2.cpp
g++ -o program3 3.cpp
g++ -o program4 4.cpp

# To run
./program1
./program2
./program3
./program4
```

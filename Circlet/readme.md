# 🎨 Circlet – DSA Pattern Printing in C++

**Circlet** is a creative and logic-based project focused entirely on solving **pattern printing problems** using **C++**. It’s a part of the **DSA project series** and is especially designed to build strong fundamentals in **loop control, nested iterations, and output formatting**.

---

## ✨ What's Inside?

This project contains a variety of **pattern problems**, including:

- 🔢 Number pyramids and sequences
- 🔁 Incremental & decremental number trees
- 🔺 Symmetrical and mirrored shapes
- 🧠 Logical binary and alternate patterns
- 💠 Palindromic and double-sided number structures
- 🎭 Complex spaces and character arrangements

These patterns challenge your understanding of:
- `for` loops
- Nested conditions
- Space and alignment logic
- Number flow and symmetry

## 🌟 Sample Patterns Included

Here are some examples of what this project covers:

| Pattern Type                        | Description                                      |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Incremental Number Triangle**     | Starts from 41, prints increasing sequences      |
| **Floyd’s Triangle Variant**        | Continuous counting numbers in triangle format   |
| **Mirrored Right Angle**            | Aligned number pyramid using spacing             |
| **Binary Alternating Pyramids**     | 1s and 0s based on even/odd logic                |
| **Diamond Style Pyramid**           | Symmetric expanding patterns                     |
| **Palindromic Number Pyramid**      | Forward and reverse number printing              |
| **Special Conditional Star Logic**  | Pattern with mix of numbers and `*` symbols      |

Each file demonstrates a unique logic structure with increasing complexity.

# 🔁 Looper – A C++ Loop Logic Project

**Looper** is a mini-project that focuses on sharpening your skills with **loops in C++**, including `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops. It contains logic-rich problems that deal with character manipulation, number analysis, and iterative operations — all aimed at helping you **master loop-based programming**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔤 Looping through characters with custom conditions
- 🔢 Digit analysis using loop-based logic
- 🧮 Mathematical operations using iterative control
- 🎯 Great for understanding `while` and `do-while` loops
- 📘 Beginner-friendly yet conceptually valuable

## 📁 Included Programs

Here's a breakdown of the programs included in **Looper**:

| File Name         | Description                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1.cpp`           | Prints alphabets from `a` to `z`, skipping every 3 letters using `do-while`|
| `2.cpp`           | Counts the total number of digits in a given integer using `while` loop    |
| `3.cpp`           | Calculates the sum of the first and last digits of a number                |

Each program is written in **simple, readable** C++ and designed to focus purely on **loop-driven logic**.
